## Notes

1) The Home Page header is not mobile responsive--To fix this I would have changed the header bar to use a dropdown that contained each Link vs. displaying them in the bar itself

2) Dropdowns were not implemented in this project--they are very complicated to get functioning in a crisp, clean matter. I can provide code that I've done on dropdowns if need, however!

3) Some content was cut from the application flow--namely the government requirements. I feel that the current implementation conveys the scope of the re-design that I wished to portray. The missing government requirements would have each become an inidivdual step in the flow. At the end, there would be a "Thanks for submitting your application" Page.

4) Yes, the code is very heavy and lengthy. React is a very verbose language by nature, and while there are ways to consolidate the amount of the methods used for validation and onChange events, it is my personal opinion that the verbosity is a boon for both readability and better understanding of the overall code.

5) As far as I am aware, the project should work out of the box (simply npm start) with mininmal issues/bugs. If you do run into any issues, however, feel free to reach out to me at branden.tenbrink@gmail.com

## Thanks for checking it out!



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
